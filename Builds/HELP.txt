The song is not owned by me, but by my friend Skatepate.
Vault Boy is from Bethesda, however I've drawn the picture myself.
Everything else belongs to me! Except for the Game Engine ofcourse.

-- CONTROLS --
The controls are quite simple, you prepare a trick by either holding W, S, A or D. (Or use the arrow keys!)
When you rlease the button, you jump! Every button has a trick. With the exception of W and S being the same trick.

A: is a Heelflip, basically your board shows the back side first. This is not so noticable when ingame.
D: is a Kickflip, just about the same as the heelflip, but it shows the front first.
W and S is an Ollie, just jumping in the air.

You restart the game with R. And you can ragdoll with Q.
ESC CLOSES DOWN YOUR GAME!

I was supposed to make a scoreboard, and even put it online. But because I had my internship I didn't
have any time for this and I had to release it like this, I only had an incredibly short time to work on it. 
It's still fun to play, though.

GRINDING
You can also grind, you do this by either holding any of the buttons listed earlier. 
You can grind on any yellow object. They all, with the exception
of W and S, have a different style of grinding.

A: When you press this while grinding you hold your board horizontally on the rail, with your back showing.
D: When you press this while grinding you hold your board horizontally on the rail, with your front showing.
W and S: just grind normally, with your board vertically aligned with the rail.

SLAMMING
You can also slam, this is handy when you're going high speeds and want to grind on something, or you 
have no time to make it to a location, and you have to jump again. 

You slam by holding any of the buttons listed earlier. Don't forget that when you're back on the ground and release a
button you'll jump again. Which can cause you making your jumps too early.

Have fun!
